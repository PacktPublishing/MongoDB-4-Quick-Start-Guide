**Learn the skills you need to work with the world's most popular NoSQL database**

## What is this book about?
MongoDB has grown to become the de facto NoSQL database with millions of users, from small start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. It can solve problems that are considered difficult, if not impossible, for aging RDBMS technologies. Written for version 4 of MongoDB, this book is the easiest way to get started with MongoDB.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get a standard MongoDB database up and running quickly
* Perform simple CRUD operations on the database using the MongoDB command shell
* Set up a simple aggregation pipeline to return subsets of data grouped, sorted, and filtered
* Safeguard your data via replication and handle massive amounts of data via sharding
* Publish data from a web form to the database using a program language driver
